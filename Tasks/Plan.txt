The big plan is: 1. call EPANET using matlab, 
2. do EPANET simulation using Matlab, 
3 understanding LDE model without control, 
4 comparing LDE and EPANET, 
5 Add control to LDE model, 
6 organizing code.
Each step, you need to add comments based on your understanding, and the 6th step should be considered during Steps 1-5.
